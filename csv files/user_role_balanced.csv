230,"Scripting or at least recording macros for the analysis they perform. This would ease the  troubleshooting and improve reproducibility. To encourage users to do so, I think we should communicate with journals about these ideas. Journals are interested in the transperent and reproducible results; thus, they can use their power to push authors implementing a good practice in the research workflows.",Balanced

So that we could refer to them in our papers.",Balanced
239,"One of the things I find so powerful about scripting is that it naturally provides accountability and transparency to science.  If you apply the same script to many images, there is a record of what you did and presumably the same thing was done to all images in the study.  The script can be submitted as part of the analysis documentation, and can be used when reproducing the study.",Balanced
247,"Accept that there is no universal ""point-and-click"" solution, and that there is great payoffs for always looking out for newer solutions.

262,BE aware of the controls to collect at the time they do their imaging,Balanced
263,I think users with experience in image analysis should spread their knowledge and acknowledge open source image analysis tools so that less experienced colleagues get access and start using image analysis,Balanced

336,Provide open datasets and descriptions of their metadata and analysis goals,Balanced
340,"Publish any filtering or post processing done on images as a series of commands, instead of  excluding these steps from their methods. ",Balanced
349,"Take time to look at images first and phrase what they want to measure as a testable hypothesis, thinking about how intensities and other measurable relate to reality. Typically people are trying to put a number on what they see, they don't always start with the right number, and this leads to momentum not towards the ideal analysis that's hard to reverse.",Balanced

372,learning core concepts of image analysis and working through prepared tutorials,Balanced
377,I guess to start with it's worth making clear to newer lab members that microscopy is hard and there is a lot to learn. Starting from that understanding rather than assuming that just sticking a poorly-prepped sample into an expensive microscopy system will yield easily quantifiable results sets people up for failure.,Balanced
378,"Users such as microscopists must embrace the technology with all its complexity and stop looking for silver bullets and easy solutions. Encouragement is through recognition, too.",Balanced
379,"Together with the creators, create guides for best practices in imaging and analysis methods, making publication of analysis workflows more common, encourage the use of open-source software   ",Balanced
386,Better methods reporting,Balanced

395,"Clearly state their needs on the imagse.sc forum, with images and examples. Share their experience with colleagues inside and outside their scientific field.",Balanced
400,"oohh... I run a lab full of biologists... #1 is to get them to understand the basics of image formation, digital image acquisition, and what a digital image is. I'm still trying to figure out the best way to train everyone to the level they need. We have mandatory readings, and we have a gatekeeper system, whereby students have to 'pass' an oral test before they can advance to being taught to use a new microscope, but at the end of the day, we still have one group (usually those who had some interest in physics/compsci) who've caught on and can think for themselves at the scope, and another group who can use the various imaging setups that they've been taught with preparations they know well, but who struggle with anything new. For trainees, a combination of readings, videos, required workshops, and interactions with more knowledgeable peers is I think optimal.",Balanced

421,Scripting workflows for better reproducibility,Balanced
422,Provide detailed methods/reproducible pipelines (as part of a publication) on how a tool was used rather than just stating that a tool was used. Cite tool developers and maintainers generously.

428,By attending more workshops related to microscopy.,Balanced
430,"Consider analysis before beginning experiments. Best achieved through comprehensive training at facilities, as well as full-pipeline assistance. Better training in image analysis/emphasis on employing specialists at imaging facilities.",Balanced
435,easier to post questions with the USERS images,Balanced
436,"Before I started trying to teach myself image analysis, I was relying on protocols given to me by other wetlab biologists and a lot of them were honestly really terrible. People just don't really know basic things like what gamma correction is and how unreliable manual counting is. I think it would be helpful if there were more accessible primers on image analysis that people read as part of learning microscopy.",Balanced
441,"Accurately and thoroughly report image analysis methods! Just because a method may be demonstrated on a specific material system or in a specific discipline doesn't mean that other disciplines know what you are doing! Make it reproducible! If I have the tools and data available, I should be able to read your article or report and reproduce the same results. Work with publishers to encourage accurate methods reporting. It is so frustrating to read an article that uses a new image processing or analysis method only to find out that I can't understand it or there is too little information to reproduce it or that it isn't even reported (ie, proprietary methods...). ",Balanced
444,Work more closely with creators,Balanced
451,Explicitly define constraints and non-constraints,Balanced
453,"My main concern with a lot of these image analysis tools are having them extract information with PERFECT data, or at least optimizing the tool around these data. Not all microscopes are setup or used by equally skilled people, so having illustrations/explanations showing what the best data for said analysis pipeline are. IE: for this pipeline, you need to do X control and it should give you Y result with minimal variation. Deviation from that will alter the power of said method. ",Balanced

474,"Ask for help more, but I don't know how to encourage. Maybe a forum for ""no stupid questions""?",Balanced
482,The users would need to be informed and understand what kind of image data needs to be generated for the analysis,Balanced
483,"We need to understand how to set up an experiment for analysis. Amateur users do not understand the limitations or capabilities of image analysis. If there were workshops teaching us how to set up a research station, software installation, how to keep it running, how to install packages, and then finally how to use some of the packages. That would be awesome. There is such a huge gap in communication between the computer world and research biologists needing image analysis.",Balanced
488,"Really keeping an open channel of communication between users and developers. The image.sc forum is a very useful way of communication but sometimes a more direct channel would perhaps be faster. Also would be good that more users themselves participate in the teaching of tutorials as we speak a different ""language"" as the developers. I think this would make a lot of the tools easier to understand and implement.",Balanced
490,"Make their voice heard with institutions, journals, funders that we need more high-quality, professionally developed, unified OPEN SOURCE tools that expedite the process and facilitate integrated image data management",Balanced
