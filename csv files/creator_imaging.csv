,Creators role-Imaging,Work type
23,Make applications platform agnostic; easy to install on different platforms,Imaging
28,Ask asap users for feedback and adapt the tools ,Imaging
80,step-by-step how-to guide that has been proof-read by non-specialist,Imaging
91,better guis ,Imaging
92,open-access,Imaging
104,Being in touch with users could be helpful,Imaging
110,To make analysis more intuitive and properly documented. ,Imaging
138,I think they are doing a good job,Imaging
146,A variety of examples. Best practices lists or videos. ,Imaging
164,Better explanations of terminology/more user friendly interfaces,Imaging
165,give more ewxamplary images,Imaging
173,communicate with users,Imaging
192,Information to understand the processes that are occuring,Imaging
200,More friendly GUIs and more video tutorials!!! Open source video tutorials by the creators,Imaging
207,accessible with plugins for use with opensource tools,Imaging
216,Explain how to adapt particular tools/pipelines for samples that don't behave as well as the example data set. ,Imaging
219,good user interface; easy to understand and logical protocols; online resources and help,Imaging
229,"Easy to follow GUI interface, documentation of tools, highlight when data doesn't meet requirements, output files that could be used for reporting of methods ",Imaging
249,"Improve user interface to require less scripting, simplify/integrate explanations of imaging principals to discourage bad practices ",Imaging
256,improve dialogue with end users ,Imaging
261,"Excellent documentation, user instructional videos with good production values, forums to ask questions to experts. Have clearly defined analysis pathways to allow users to recreate images from others/their past selves.",Imaging
270,more detailed documentation and tutorials,Imaging
282,"Especially for open source tools, better documentation!! Even some very popular tools have documentation that assumes a relatively high baseline of coding knowledge which can either scare away new users or lead them to applying the tool incorrectly. Perhaps a documentation best practice guide?",Imaging
335,Get far away from plugins that stop being supported like it happens a lot in fiji,Imaging
342,Make analysis possible with 0 coding skills by users (point and click),Imaging
361,Making it as user friendly as possible,Imaging
364,"I think there should a common and large platform, kind of database, where developers could post their software, tools, plugins, etc and put examples of how those could be applied to solve a specific problem. Probably an Imaging network, such as the GBI, BINA, COBA, etc, could create such database so that all of us, microscopists and software developers could have access to. I'm saying this because there are a lot of tools scattered elsewhere and at some point we don't even know they exist. However, even some FIJI plugins lack a better explanation of how they work. ",Imaging
382,"Annotated Github pages! Biologists need help installing and running complex code, that is the reality. I can't tell how many times I've read a fascinating image analysis paper (for example the recent deep learning papers from Emma Lundberg and the human protein atlas), and been completely unable to run code due to lack of good annotation.  ",Imaging
399,good tutorials for using their software (explanation of parameters plus examples which normally work...),Imaging
429,Websites can have video tutorials? Or maybe encourage experienced users to submit video tutorials.,Imaging
443,Simpler explains of processing functions and variables,Imaging
446,Better graphic interfaces and how-to sessions in the Help area,Imaging
461,"make it more user friendly. if it's not easy to use for non-coders, it won't be broadly used",Imaging
466,User friendly GUIs,Imaging
