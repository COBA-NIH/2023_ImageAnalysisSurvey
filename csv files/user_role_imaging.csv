,Users role - Imaging,Work type
23,learn basic coding in order to be able to adapt existing tools to specific needs,Imaging
28,Contact image analysis specialist before doing the experiment ,Imaging
80,helpful checklist of simple best practise that is not too onerous?,Imaging
92,reproducibility,Imaging
104,Maybe creating a basic package tool to learn in courses,Imaging
138,practice,Imaging
146,Document and annotate workflows. Keep some example data with processing workflow for future reference.,Imaging
165,First do imaging right,Imaging
173,communicate with developers,Imaging
192,"Discuss image analysis needs/problems, or desirable workflows",Imaging
200,Not sure there,Imaging
207,write full methods desrciptions within publications. Make published data available,Imaging
216,Pay more attention to dynamic range than what looks pretty to human eyes,Imaging
219,engage more from the start of experiments. ,Imaging
229,"incorporation/maintenance of metadata in image files, reporting of methods used",Imaging
231,Better experimental design and replication. Discuss experiments / best practice guidelines for standard preparations prior to starting.,Imaging
249,Learn more about the physics and other principals behind imaging to understand potential sources of problems or misleading data. Ideally integrate it more with life science education,Imaging
256,improve dialogue with creators,Imaging
261,Report the use of the tools and feedback to developers/creators,Imaging
270," learn basics of image analysis, participate in workshops etc. ",Imaging
282,Consider analysis needs before starting data collection!! ,Imaging
335,Be less willing to use badly designed GUIs and half baked solutions,Imaging
355,clearer best practices and staining + imaging guidelines ,Imaging
361,Keep informed of new developments,Imaging
364,"by creating a common and large platform where several distinct imaging topics or problems,  analyzed by any software, plugins, etc, could be posted as examples, so that they can be used as a guidance by us, the users, to solve our own imaging problems. ",Imaging
382,"Plan experiments better to obtain data that can be analyzed. Have clear questions that need answers and clear reasons why existing tools are sufficient. Users also need to be more flexible (e.g., learning basic Python or Matlab and be able to run annotated code). ",Imaging
399,"provide ""bad"" images for software testing, not only the images we are proud of",Imaging
429,Experiences users can share their expertise at conferences/workshops. Students perhaps can compete for best tutorial?,Imaging
443,Pilot test an imaging protocol can be used to confirm the desired information can be extracted.,Imaging
446,Start thinking on image acquisition if aiming for image analysis or just a nice image. Set ups are quite different and sometimes you acquire a data set that is not fir for purpose for image analysis,Imaging
461,"understand basic coding tasks, educated developers on the limitations of the imaging technique",Imaging
466,Interact with creators to better inform on analysis outputs ,Imaging
