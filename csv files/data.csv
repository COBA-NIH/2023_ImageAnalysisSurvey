About the conference, when the designers of the tool were able to explain their tool to the person without a lot of computational background, this was helpful. The I2K conference stated that it was open for amateurs but much of the content was unreachable for those of us without substantial background in programming. There were many tools that I could not get installed because of my lack of knowledge and experience, let alone understand the tool well enough to perform the tutorials suggested before I EVER even attended the conference. I found the workshops of little worth because I couldn't follow along with the program. I was frustrated that the seminars were question and answer periods about how to use the software and not introductions on explaining what the software does. The Q&A has its uses but for true BEGINNERS, we needed explanation for what we can do. We don't know what is out there and often don't understand the documentation well enough to know if it will work for us.",,"What do I need to know about setting up anaconda?

Many low budget Research labs do not have access to an imaging analysis core, don't know they exist, and don't know they need one. They may get sold a high dollar software to do something very specific that can be done for free with know how. If you want your tools to really be used by experts and amateurs make your program easy to install and give it a GUI interface.","We need to understand how to set up an experiment for analysis. Amateur users do not understand the limitations or capabilities of image analysis. If there were workshops teaching us how to set up a research station, software installation, how to keep it running, how to install packages, and then finally how to use some of the packages. That would be awesome. There is such a huge gap in communication between the computer world and research biologists needing image analysis.","I apologize if I am coming across harsh about the conference. I'm sure it was hugely successful and helpful for most of your attendees. However, there is a segment of your attendees that probably felt left out because they didn't understand the jargon or because of the enormous effort it was to prepare for the workshops that then didn't even do the thing they thought the software package was designed to do. Yes, some of this is on the amateur user but beyond hours of reading how are we supposed to bridge that gap?

Perhaps is good to have video tutorials that also explain for which type of data the tool is most adequate. Even having a summary table with that would be usefull. Although the ZeroCost4Mic for example is a great initiative, written tutorials are hard to navigate through for non computational biologists. Having more videos like for example the ones that Robert Haase or that Craig Daly has on youtube would be very useful.","Really keeping an open channel of communication between users and developers. The image.sc forum is a very useful way of communication but sometimes a more direct channel would perhaps be faster. Also would be good that more users themselves participate in the teaching of tutorials as we speak a different ""language"" as the developers.
