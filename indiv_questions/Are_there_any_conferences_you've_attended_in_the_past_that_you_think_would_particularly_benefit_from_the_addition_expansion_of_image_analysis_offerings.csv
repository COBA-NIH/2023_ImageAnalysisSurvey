A lot of labs could benefit from proper microscopy and imaging practice independent of the conference.

ELMI
"ELMI can be pretty variable when it comes to image analysis, I think they should have separate analysis and data management sessions (often combined currently)"
EMAG & Microscience
EMBL
EMBL course on Super-resolution (STED). It would have been helpful if they had a session dedicated to image analysis/ deconvolution. 
"EMBO Seeing is Believing, lightsheet microscopy conferences (LSFM)"
"Evolutionary Developmental Biology, Society for the study of evolution"
Expansion of image analysis offerings at ABRF
FOM _ offering hands on tutorials; QBI offers tutorials but they are at the end of the day of a very packed schedule thus not very useful as our brains are already overwhelmed. Would be useful to actually offer more dedicated sessions in the mornings.
"FOM, ELMI"
Focus on Microscopy
Focus on Microscopy Conference
"Honestly, I think every biology conference could benefit from this, especially just in getting the researchers to actively think about alternative imaging/analysis approaches that might be more applicable for their research"
I don't know now
"I had attended a 10-day workshop called Image2Numbers by JNCASR. Even though the techniques taught were useful, the codes associated with it were a little difficult to understand."
I haven't attended any conference/workshop
I think every conference could benefit from showcasing image analysis methods related go the conference topic.
I think most large life science or medicine conferences could benefit from a session on tools and image processing - it can be tricky to get tools into the hands of the people that would benefit most
"I'm organising a data analysis in AFM conference (or session) with the RMS and am excited to see that being integrated into MMC. I don't think this exists for any AFM conferences and would like it to e.g. AFMBiomed, iSPM, SPMonSPM, "
I2K 2022 - more training sessions for beginners

ISAC 
"Imaging conferences not always accessible for scientists of all disciplines (funding reasons, unis unwilling to pay attendance if youâ€™re project isnâ€™t an imaging topic). Online retranscription or video repository would be nice "
Large society conferences like ASM or ARVO could have an imaging workshop session to address challenges in specific biological systems
"Lighst sheet microscopy conference (but I attended in 2014, so long time ago...)"
"M&M already has, but APS annual meetings, MRS meetings would highly benefit."
"M&M, MRS"
"M&M, Zeiss CLEM."
MICCAI
MMC

"MMC in Manchester, maybe?"
MMC; 
Manchester Microscope Congress
Many biology/medicine focused conferences would benefit from a more analytical presence. 
"Many commercial shows: The Battery Show, Ceramics Expo, TMS, ASBMR, Neuroscience"
Microscience Microscopy Congress (MMC run by RMS)
Microscopy and Microanalysis
Microscopy and Microanalysis
"Most I attend (e.g MMC, SEMT, TOSCA, etc. seem to have a selection of workshops and sessions related to Image Analysis"
"Most biological questions now need image analysis pipelines to produce results, but I think image analysis conferences should be distinct from biology."

"Probably every conference, but it's a big investment for any lab to do it well."

"Society of Toxicology Pathology, American College of Veterinary Pathology"
Spatial/3D-oriented conferences in general - I think large spatial data is particularly challenging
"Summer Biomechanics, Bioengineering, and Biotransport Conference"
"The AQLM course at the MBL in Woods Hole is top notch, fantastic instructors and cutting-edge equipment, and we collected amazing images but the analysis portion of it was lacking. "

"Yes, RNA imaging and analysis"
Yes. Digital pathology and AI congress. Though this seems more geared towards clinicians and pathologists rather than 'basic research'
Yes. The meetings of the Pathological Society of GB and I
any life science conference
any microscopy conference should have a dedicated image analysis session
ascb could use more image analysis sessions
experimental biology- there are booths from vendors but it would be a great place for open-source software to advertise.
