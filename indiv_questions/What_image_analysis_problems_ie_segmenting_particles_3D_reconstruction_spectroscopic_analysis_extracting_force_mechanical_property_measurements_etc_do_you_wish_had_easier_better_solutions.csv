3D nuclei or cellular segmentation 
3D reconstruction
"3D reconstructions, automated advanced segmentation methods"
Clustering. I still don't trust a single clustering algorithm to be correct.
Correlative microscopy/data atlas- matching datasets across techniques
Easier software front end
"Extracting forces, sptPALM (localization microscopy), deep learning"
Extraction of 3D properties of objects in volume.
"I wish it was easier to get intensity vs time trajectories from movies (drift correction, background identification, segmenting particles, fitting with 2D Gaussians, and sometimes normalizing to an individual fluorophore)"
"Image autocorrelation for SIMS, 3D imaging in SIMS."
Integrated Density
"Inverse problems, and specifically phase imaging"
Ptychography :-)
Segmenting non-round particles that have some overlap
"Tomographic reconstruction, 2D image analysis in terms of producing statistics from your intensity map in a standard SEM image "
"With a terrible contrast, it is bad to look for a contour. What can be done here? Think more about the illumination in the visual experiment =)))"
