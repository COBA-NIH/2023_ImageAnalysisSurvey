Depends on ongoing projects
Different approaches to perform the same analysis (pros and cons).
Difficult to prioritise as all topics can be useful.
Dream3D for large and/or complex datasets e.g. strained material
"Estimating error (computational and experimental) of methods when applied to my own data, discussion of pitfalls, available test data sets, getting started guides"
"Focus on open source options, not software where access is an issue. "
"For my personal work, a topic on making high-level image analysis techniques and pipelines accessible for users (e.g. using GUIs, or guidance on how to structure instructions) would be greatly beneficial for myself, and a lot of other analysts that perform similar roles to me)"
Full Python walkthroughs for biological questions aimed at beginners (with Jupyter notebooks and good documentation and reasoning for tool/module/filter use)
General data labelling - not only bboxes and class labels for CNN's but also those for GNN's. Also gaussian processes and auto encoders as I've heard they could be quite useful
General good practices and specialized analysis tool in terms of quantification of images
General theory
"Generalist tutorials on segmentation - a wide overview of the many tools and techniques, from classical non-ML approaches to the deep learning approaches, would be immensely valuable to many people who are beginners."
Gentle introductions for non-experts. Application-specific workflows that do not dwell much on theory and instead focus on insight (key in commercial).
"Getting to grips with Python. The absolute basics. How to install it, which instal method to use. Why there seem to be some many options."
Goal-focussed tutorials that explore how to address a specific problem (e.g. classifying cells in tissues based on morphology) rather than what a particular tool can do. A good tutorial suggests a pipeline and introduces the required tools but also explains where one could deviate and what the limitations of the particular approach would be.

"I am not used to conferences so that might actually be common. I would say some kind of presentation of a particular field, like a review, and then a debate/discussion between experts. "
"I can only speak to my experience using ImageJ, but an issue I have is that tutorials all seem to be with older versions of the software than I have and sometimes there are discrepancies. I guess it's hard to make video tutorials for a software that updates so frequently. But that might be something to try to address. Other than that, a lot of my issues come from working with images of cells with a non-round/branched morphology, so tutorials addressing analyzing structures with different morphologies from round particles could be helpful."
I don't know
"I need to learn python so I can use napari, "
"I think 1) best practices in choosing FPs for specific applications - live cell, confocal, etc, and 2) a detailed breakdown of the ""IdentifyPrimaryObjects"" function of CellProfiler and how to compartmentalize it into its own modules (gaussian filter, threshold, fill holes, etc) would be super helpful."
I think a workshop on how to acquire images and do labelling for machine learning would be useful.
"I think general image analysis workshops are lacking and sometimes the offers are ""too specific/niche/specialized"" which might be off putting for new attendees."
"I think it is more beneficial to cover a topic (e.g., ""Cell Segmentation in 3D...""), introduce the problem and the best/current ways to analyze the data and future directions. "
I think the key to success is education and training (thorough training) of users and a LOT of expectation management.
I wish there were more videos of people explaining how to use my specific software (CellSens)
"I would like to learn how to better use ImageJ tools, especially for 3d image analysis"
I would like to see better ways to customise background subtraction techniques. Intensity analysis of images where the SNR is not as good is something I'd like to learn.
"I would love to see more about tracking over time -- but not only about the tracking itself, more about the subsequent analysis of the data and visualization. Especially detection of similarity profiles over time and cluster detection."
"I would love to see more theory on how to solve a particular problem with different software.  So, less like ""this is how you segment endosomes in ilastik,"" and more like: ""here are some concepts to bear in mind when trying to segment endosomes, and here are five different workflows in different programs to do it."" That way I can develop an idea of the strengths and weakness of various approaches (and not simply use the method that I was taught because it's the only think I know)."
"I'd love intermediate level. Most of the conferences I see are either very basic Fiji/python or full on heavy program development. Right now I'm trying to bridge the gap between those two spaces and finding it quite difficult to find the right resource. Or even a course/seminar on how to move from primarily lab-based to primarily computational and what roles are available.

I'd also love sessions on how to initiate image analysis. You've collected a dataset, how do you decide what to extract from your images. Or which existing script to adapt for your use. What are the best practices the experts in the field use for this?"
"I'd really like a broad overview of 4D-STEM tools (ie, ptych vs NBED etc)"
