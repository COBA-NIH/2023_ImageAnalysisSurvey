Gross structural analysis
HCS Data Analysis
Hard to answer this ~ Image analysis can always be improved and it depends largely on the image
"I have an easy time with: finding nuclei, counting segmented cells, background correction, measuring fluorescence intensity within a selection."
I think almost every step of image analysis still has plenty of improvement to be had.
"I would argue no single problem has been, ""solved"". However, I think great progress has been made on non-purely threshold based analysis, nuclear identification, cell segmentation, and phase-contrast analysis. Great strides have also recently been made with respect to handling large data sets (though still a long way to go)."
Image analysis as I understand it is all a work in progress.
