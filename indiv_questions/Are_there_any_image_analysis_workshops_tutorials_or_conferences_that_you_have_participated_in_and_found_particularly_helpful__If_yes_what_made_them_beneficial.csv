2022 I2K conference
A general introduction to ImageJ.  Helped to showcase what is possible.
ABRF
ABRF 
AIM at Berkeley
"AIM at UC Berkeley, ABRF Image Analysis Workshop"
"APT&M, MTEX workshop"
AQLM
AQLM- in depth explanation of theory; AIM- hands on practice; Neubias- detailed workflows; SciPy- introduction to new libraries I was unfamiliar with
"Actually, I attended a CellProfiler workshop at HMS. It was amazing. Every step was useful, from getting me used to building pipelines, to trying out different modules, to tying in ilastic. In one sense, that last step (ilastic tie-in) might have been the most valuable, just because it would have been hard for me to even consider trying to bridge two software together.
The workshop's material and test pipeline/images I've actually saved and use as training materials for my own students. I hope you guys don't mind!"
"Advanced Imaging Methods Workshop at UC Berkeley, for new tool and technique development"
Allen Institute for Cell Science Bioimage Informatics was a good mix of workshops and relevant talks
An accessible (= easy to follow for non-specialists) intro to the theory underpinning the method combined with walkthroughs/use case scenarios that clearly articulate benefits and limitations
Aqlm at mbl
"At the I2K conference, the interaction with others is outstanding. This benefits collaboration and use of tools in the long run."
Attended a Cell Profiler workshop that was great for getting started. It just got everyone to point where you could explore the software
BioVoxxel seminar on site - tailored themes to our problems
"Bioimage Analysis with Python, a course at Cambridge University. It was a five-day in-person course replete with hands-on exercises that could immediately be applied to the problems your normally face. By the end of the course, my image analysis skills had been taken to a whole new level."
"C-CAMP, India, image analysis workshop."
Cell profiler. Tutorial was very clear and TAs were really helpful
"CellProfiler workshops, QuPath workshops"
Clearliness and practical examples
"Community event, hands-on hackathon"
Does Robert Haases bioimaging intro course count? If yes - the amalgamation of theory and immediate hands on  experience. Also Robert and his collegues make the environment of the course very welcoming and safe for asking questions.
Dragonfly ran a great series during the pandemic.  What made them particularly exciting was that they were pretty advanced and yet hands-on. . . 
EC-CLEM workshop at CLEM COMULIS training scholl
ELMI 2021 ImageJ workshop
EMAG Hyperspy workshop
EMBL AMBA. Interaction with experts.
EMBO 3D developmental imaging in Oeiras. Take your own sample and have experts help you to optimise the imaging.
"EMBO course on plant imaging; highly beneficial because good ration of theory/hands-on, and personalized advice on our specific issues. Also liked ELMI meetings in which there was a session to teach ImageJ macro writing for total beginners, this was really helpful."
ESRIC summer school - good balance between theory lectures and practical workshops. 
ESRIC super resolution school - immersive experience with high quality technical lectures combined with hands on experience 
Easy illustrative examples that can be followed in real time during webinar.
"Embl course in machine learning, set a good Basis of the Tonic and have confidence Go dich deeper"
Expand processing knowledge
FiJi workshop 
Focus on tools and hands-on workshops that let me get started processing real data quickly
Hackathon
Hackathon for tracking. Really great to compare each others methods and approachs on the same datasets. And it's fun. 
Hands on 
Hands on practice
"Hands on time, applying skills to my images with expert support"
"Hands on, demos with practical examples of complex datasets and solutions, "
"Hands on, reverse engineering of problem, call4help sessions"
Hands-on examples to back up lectures
"Hands-on, networking, top quality teachers, presenting advanced tools and methods, presenting workflows, accompny material, pre-course learning requirments"
"Huygens put on a good workshop with their deconvolution package. They provided a walk through with example data, PDFs and offered the whole thing downloadable after. Imaris has offered a similar in person experience without the recording. "
Hyperspy workshop (by ePSIC staff at EMAG)
I didn't have any background and the workshops helped me a lot to understand many concepts that I had read but it was in practice where I realized about the real meaning 
"I learned a lot from the CLMC, probably the best training I've had. I wish i knew more about simple coding but I couldn't keep up with the one session in a conference I attended. "
"I watched Robert Hansens YouTube class, that was super informative and helpful. About the conference, when the designers of the tool were able to explain their tool to the person without a lot of computational background, this was helpful. The I2K conference stated that it was open for amateurs but much of the content was unreachable for those of us without substantial background in programming. There were many tools that I could not get installed because of my lack of knowledge and experience, let alone understand the tool well enough to perform the tutorials suggested before I EVER even attended the conference. I found the workshops of little worth because I couldn't follow along with the program. I was frustrated that the seminars were question and answer periods about how to use the software and not introductions on explaining what the software does. The Q&A has its uses but for true BEGINNERS, we needed explanation for what we can do. We don't know what is out there and often don't understand the documentation well enough to know if it will work for us."
"I went to a Cell Profiler workshop which was interesting but as I didn't have immediate need, I never put it into practice.   Ability to ask questions (and listen into to other's questions) was great.  I'd encourage lab members to attend."
"I've only been to one, which was a Fiji workshop offered by my university's microscopy core facility. It was relatively helpful, but I found making an appointment with the analysis specialist who gave it to talk about my data one-on-one was more helpful for my project. It did give me a lot of background knowledge about image analysis and image data in general though which was nice."

Ilastik and Cell profiler 
"Image Analysis for Biologists, Cambridge, was really helpful at the start of my PhD and getting me started off in my imaging career. Covered Icy, FIJI and MATLAB and gave a good grounding in basics and best practises. 3 day residential course, IIRC."
Image analysis part helps me a lot. Reconstruction of images in STORM microscopy.
ImageJ/FIJI course by Kota Miura; great script that I have handed on to many.
Imaris online workshops. They show every step using the software and itâ€™s easy to try the things yourself.
Imaris workshop - able to work with our own images + few people attending (more efficient)
Interaction with tutors
Introduction of updates of existing software we use; use of open source software; having recordings available after the sessions;
It's helpful when they use real images which are more difficult to analyze
"Janelia (several years ago), some of the subevents at Photonics West"

Mix of talks (for tool discovery) and workshops (how to use tools)
"Most LFD (University Irvine), fluorescence foundation etc. workshops were excellent because they have small-ish groups (of 50) and lots of one-on-one time."
"My company had an in-house course that used data generated at the company as examples for the course, with accompanying Jupyter notebooks and I found that very helpful. It was helpful to see the exact type of data I would use (confocal fluorescence microscopy) and how analysis was performed."
N/a

Some InForm video tutorials were very helpful
Some sessions of Focus on Microscopy Conference
"Started learning on the Coursera platform. However, due to the war, it was not possible to start practical tasks (sanctions). At the present time we have left Russia, tk. we are against war. looking for a job, trying to find a job in America."
Step by step guide with examples
TOSCA
"The ABRF segmentation online workshop held recently following their reproducibility survey. We submitted our segmentation strategies and results, then attended the workshop and had two sessions with breakout rooms so we could see representatives of different image analysis software companies demonstrate the same exercises with their software. This allowed beginners to try and solve it ourselves, then see how the experts did it, and we could do so for multiple platforms. Recordings were also uploaded to youtube so we could see full workflows for the same problems on multiple platforms (5 I think). As a beginner who works in a core and is helping users with their own acquisition this was very helpful as it gives beginners a solid grounding for image analysis workflows and the differences between analysis platforms."
The Microscopy Society of Ireland always holds fantastic conferences with a huge range of modalities. It's great to see approaches for image analysis from non-biological fields as they provide a completely different grounding for approaching certain tasks
The videos by Johanna M. Dela Cruz have been useful
There have been a lot of virtual resources in the pandemic that were useful.
These are rarely useful - best case results or generic solutions are often presented. 
To obtain info about the methods for image analysis
"ToScA North America, FIB-SEM Annual Meeting, XCT, M&M - each is dedicated to microscopy and I learn much by speaking with attendees about their favorite tools"
Training schools and webinars organized by NEUBIAS. They made image analysis available to me when I was a total newby and had nobody to ask in my close environment. They introduced a wide range of analysis tools/softwares to use and explained how to access them and how to proceed to learn more.
UCLA QCBio workshop. interactive
"Watched QuPath workshop on YouTube and it was helpful although I still am a complete novice at using that program. The ability to watch, and re-watch, segments is very useful."
"We did an in-house Nikon Elements course that was really good, particularly because we had real data samples to analyze."
We had to solve a problem in the lab. Usually my postdocs or students do the actual analysis
"Well targeted to audience, interactive, engaging speakers"
When detailed and practical enough to imply in running projects. 
When people show concrete example solutions for their image analysis problems that can give me ideas for my own image analysis problems (or for my colleagues)
"When the tutorial had a pdf or slides we could follow, we were shown a few steps, then did them in small beakout rooms with a helper, and back and forth like this between the main session and the little breakout groups where we could share our screen if there were issues"
Working in small groups with experts 
Workshop on using Imaris for segmenting 3D objects
"X Computer Optimized Microscopy course (Barcelona, June 2018)"
Yes Ihave attended one last year conducted by JNCASR Bangaluru India . workshop conducted by them was benificial
"Yes ~ Simple, but in depth explanations. Most principles in image analysis are simple to follow if explained correctly. It is easy to go to quickly through a concept, or over complicate it. I enjoy learning from people who are passionate and expert. ~ Lots of diagrams!"
"Yes, Image2Numbers workshop organized by JNCASR. It was not very helpful. Too much specific information instead of the fundamental basics."
"Yes, a 3 day workshop that showed multiple tools and image types"
"Yes, deep learning methods"
"Yes, real-life examples fully processed. Summarizing tips and tricks or best practices."
"Yes. I think it is very helpful to provide a data set and time so peaple can apply what is being explained. Also, recording of the sessions are very useful to come back later on."
Yes. The great tutors and their availability for the dumbest of questions
Youtube series on FIJI/ImageJ by Robert Haase and ZeroCostDL4Mic by Henriques and collaborators. Both these resources provide narrated videos that are exceptionally well done and easy to follow along with (user walks viewer through software). ZeroCost also has a well annotated github/wiki page for topics not covered in videos.
