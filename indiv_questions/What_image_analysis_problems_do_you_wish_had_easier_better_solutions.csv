"I think certain things just are not easy. period. The drive toward easier solutions is understandable, but some things just aren't. There is a broad palette of tools out there already, most of them purporting to be easy solutions, or automated (e.g. skeletonization and 3D filament trackers) they do work on very specific standard systems, but often fail when going into untapped new types of images. I guess what I am trying to say is, that instead of becoming easier, image analysis tools should focus on better, more broadly employable, robust and reproducible, That will be demanding on the user side and will require intensive care and meticulous data acquisition - it is not going to be easy, but better, in my opinion."
